# HackMIT 2016

Our hackathon group consisting of Robert Henning, Jacob Miske, Catherine Zeng, and Mayukha Vadari created SoundTrak, an audio remote controller.

Our demo included giving the remote controll settings so that it can control video playback through clapping. We used an arduino and multiple microphones to respond to clicks. The two microphones means that the device is directional, and that random noise can't trigger the controls. We placed Top 10 in HackMIT.

To use the Python GUI, the package tkinter is needed.
